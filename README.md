# ConnectingFish

This project aims to connect fisheries with fish suppliers and consumers through a web application. Addressing the disconnect between fisheries and consumers.  The project involves designing a database to store qualitative and quantitative information about fisheries. The backend development will use Express.js for Node.js to create APIs for CRUD operations and implement authentication and authorisation mechanisms.
