ConnectingFish is a web application designed to connect fisheries with fish suppliers and consumers, addressing the disconnect between these entities. The project involves database design, backend development using Express.js for Node.js, and frontend development using React. This README provides an overview of the project's components and features.

Database Design
The database for ConnectingFish includes entities for fisheries, suppliers, and consumers, each with attributes such as ID, name, location, and contact information. 

Entities
Fisheries: Stores information about fisheries.
Suppliers: Stores information about fish suppliers.
Users: Stores information about consumers.


Relationships
Fisheries to Suppliers: A fishery can supply to multiple suppliers.
Suppliers to Fisheries: A supplier can receive supplies from multiple fisheries.

Backend Development
The backend of ConnectingFish is built using Express.js for Node.js. It includes APIs for CRUD operations for fisheries, suppliers, consumers, products, orders, etc. Authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to ensure secure access to the application.

APIs
CRUD Operations: APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
Authentication: Implement authentication mechanisms for secure access.

Frontend Development
The frontend of ConnectingFish is developed using React. It includes components for displaying fisheries, suppliers, consumers, products, orders, etc. Forms are created for adding and updating information, and the user interface allows suppliers to place orders, fisheries to manage their products, and consumers to browse and purchase products.

Integration
Integration involves connecting the backend applications to the database to fetch and store data. APIs are used to communicate between the frontend and backend, enabling users to interact with the application.

Features
Database Integration: Connect backend applications to the database.
API Integration: Use APIs to communicate between the frontend and backend.
User Interface: Interface for suppliers to place orders, fisheries to manage products, and consumers to browse and purchase products.
